	Do here the tests you consider.

	1. To test a section from a specific project, do:
		1.1.	Go to 'tests\CMakeLists.txt' and link the targets you need for your test.
		1.2.	#include here all the header files you need, using the path relative to the 'Additional Include Directories' path.

	2. Now do the tests you consider.

	3. You're free! If you think your test is important enough to be used in a significative number of situations and/or can be helpful
	for further	developing this project, consider implementing it in a new source file for a commit; otherwise, clean your test code once
	you're done	and don't ever commit it!
